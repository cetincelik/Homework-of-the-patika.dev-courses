Project 1

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1) Write down the stages of the sequence given above according to the sort type.

2) Write the Big-O notation.

3) Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the top of the series.

4) What case does the number 18 fall under after the array is sorted? Write.


5) Write down the first 4 steps of the [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] sequence according to the Insertion Sort.



Solutions

1) [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1. [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]

2. [16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]

3. [2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]

4. [2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6]

5. [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]



2) Big O Notation- worst case
n!= n*(n+1)/2= (n^2+n)/2 => O(n^2)

3) Time complexity.
best case: O(n)

average case: O(n^2)

worst case: O(n^2)

4) Which case for 18?
 avarage case

5) First 4 Insertion Sort steps [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[[3,7,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[3,5,7,2,8,9,4,15,6]
